chao.js

aka

Taking things I like from other game frameworks and throwing them into entity-component flavored goulash.

It's currently a messy work in progress. Only when I finish developing a proper game with it I will consider it finished. Don't expect any documentation before that. ;)

# Credits:

Other people's work I was inspired by or just stole some code from.

Seth Robinson's [Proton SDK](http://www.rtsoft.com/wiki/doku.php?id=proton) - blew my mind back when it was released. And it's still awesome!

Sos Sosowki's [allegro.js](https://github.com/TheSos/allegrojs), from which I shamelessly took most of the core code - images loading and manipulation or keyboard and mouse input among many other things.

Rex van der Spuy's [ga.js](https://github.com/kittykatattack/ga) - some input, audio and viewport scaling code is stolen from this guy's framework.

Photonstorm's [Phaser](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser) - took the Visibility Handler from there and possibly some other minor things I don't remember.
