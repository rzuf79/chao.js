Taking things I like from other game frameworks and throwing them into entity-component flavored goulash.

# Credits:

Sos Sosowki's [allegro.js](https://github.com/TheSos/allegrojs), from which I shamelessly took most of the core code - images loading and manipulation or keyboard and mouse input among many other things.

Rex van der Spuy's [ga.js](https://github.com/kittykatattack/ga) - some input, audio and viewport scaling code is stolen from this guy's framework.

Photonstorm's [Phaser](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser) - took the Visibility Handler from there and possibly some other minor things I don't remember.
